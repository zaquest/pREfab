Task list:

 * Think how to DRY Data.Corner (clockWise, counterClockWise, isLine)
   and Data.Segment (outside, inside, onLine)
 * Any way to generate binary files in purescript? Do I have to write
   my own? Look at purescript-arraybuffer-types.
 * Implement prefab file generation
 * Write tests for Linear _low priority_

Whish list:

 * Editing history (undo/redo) purescript-localstorage
 * Polygons history (list of polygons that were edited previously)
   purescript-localstorage
 * Polygon exporting/importing

 * Set up test infrastructure with purescript-test-unit (22-09-2016)
 * Finish Data.Polygon (clip, simplify) (23-09-2016)
 * Make whole thing build again (25-09-2016)
 * Fix sutherlandHodgeman, it creates empty polygons for inner
   operation (25-09-2016)
 * Write tests for Data.* (26-09-2016)
 * validatePoly gives wrong results because of sutherlandHodgeman
   (26-09-2016)
